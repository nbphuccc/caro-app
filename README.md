Hello everyone. In winter 2024, while I was waiting for a ferry ride, I attempted at making caro, a larger version of tic-tac-toe played on a larger grid, the goal is the first to get 5 in a row wins.
The logic is quite simple, but this is one of my favourite games to play on a notebook with your deskmate from junior through high school.
My first attempt succeeded(?), the result is my other repository, caro-chess, which was made using rudimentary java and graphics2D.
After taking some more classes, I have now upgraded it into a fully interactive 2-player web app game.
The UI is quite intuitive, I believe(?). You can either host a room, for which you will be provided with a unique room code. You can then have the option of copying the room code, where your friend can then paste it by clicking the Join Game button in the Main Menu,
or copying the link that your friend can just paste in the browser. That's it. Enjoy the game.
Remember, X always goes first!
